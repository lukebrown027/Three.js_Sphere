# Three.js_Sphere
 A website I created following a YouTube tutorial using Three.js. The user is able to spin the ball by clicking and holding the mouse. The color and lighting changes based on the rotation of the ball.

To run the website, open the project folder in VS Code and type "npm run dev" in the terminal. Click on the local host link. It will open in a web browser.
